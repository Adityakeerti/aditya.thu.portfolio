                <p>Today we covered interviews and JAM sessions, learning how to
                    create stories and practice effective self-presentation.We had a GD(Group Discussion) round today.
                    The whole class was divided into 7-8 groups.
                    I think Me and My group performed more than I expected because of almost all the good speakers of
                    the class were in the same group which made it expectionally well.
                    I am saying all this because when our group was discussing the topic (iPad kids), Whole class was
                    paying more attention as compared to other groups.
                    Thank You
